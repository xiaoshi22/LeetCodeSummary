## 200. Number of Islands

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
>
> Given an `m x n` 2d `grid` map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.
>
> An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: grid = [
>   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
> ]
> Output: 1
> ```

> **Example 2:**

> Input: grid = [
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
