## 723. Candy Crush

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy-crush/)
>
> This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.
>
> Given a 2D integer array `board` representing the grid of candy, different positive integers `board[i][j]` represent different types of candies. A value of `board[i][j] = 0` represents that the cell at position `(i, j)` is empty. The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move. Now, you need to restore the board to a *stable state* by crushing candies according to the following rules:
>
> 1. If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, "crush" them all at the same time - these positions become empty.
> 2. After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)
> 3. After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.
> 4. If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is *stable*), then return the current board.
>
> You need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return the current board.
