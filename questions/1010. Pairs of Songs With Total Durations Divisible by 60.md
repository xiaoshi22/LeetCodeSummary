## 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

> Medium - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/)
>
> You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds.
>
> Return *the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by* `60`. Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
> (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
> (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
> (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: time = [60,60,60]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.

### Approach 1: Reminder

- Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int[] reminders = new int[60];
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int t: time) {
            int r = t % 60;
            count += reminders[(60 - r)%60];
            reminders[r]++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
